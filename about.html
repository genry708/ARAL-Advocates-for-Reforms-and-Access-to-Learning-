 <h2>How ARAL Came to Be</h2>
 <p>ARAL (Advocates for Reforms and Access to Learning) began as a personal vision of mine. As a student, I have 
    always been aware of the challenges that many children face in accessing quality education, especially those 
    in rural and marginalized areas. At first, it was just me ‚Äî one learner with the dream of helping others learn,
     despite the barriers of poverty, distance, and lack of resources. I started by researching the realities of
      education inequality and sharing them with my classmates and teachers.</p>
 <p>Over time, others who shared the same passion joined me. From being a solo effort, ARAL has grown into a 
    small but dedicated group of young advocates working together to spread awareness, push for reforms, and 
    support learners in need. What started with one voice has become a collective movement that believes in one 
    mission: to make sure no learner is left behind.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Ricagen A. Genita</strong>, the founder of ARAL.  
      I am a student who believes that education is the most powerful tool for change.  
      My journey started with small acts‚Äîhelping classmates with lessons and raising awareness 
      about the struggles of learners in rural communities.  
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, it was just me. But later, others who shared the same passion joined.  
      Now, ARAL has grown into a youth-led advocacy group that works together to make sure 
      no learner is left behind.
