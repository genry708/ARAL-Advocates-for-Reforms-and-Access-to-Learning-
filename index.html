 <h2> Why ARAL Exists</h2>
 <p> Education is a fundamental right, yet millions of children around the world‚Äîespecially those who are in rural 
    and marginalized communities‚Äîare still denied access to quality 
    learning. In the Philippines, many students face overcrowded classrooms, long commutes to schools, and a lack
    of textbooks and facilities. Rural and marginalized communities are often the most affected, with children 
    struggling to keep up due to poverty and limited resources (<a href="https://mb.com.ph/2025/07/29
    /philippine-education-reform-deped-unveils-10-year-quality-basic-education-plan">DepEd, 2025</a>). </p> 

 <p> Globally, the problem is just as severe. According to <a href="https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/out-school-
    children-and-youth">UNESCO (2025)</a>, more than 258 million children and youth 
    are out of school, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, about 31% of school-age youth are not enrolled. In the 
    Philippines, while over 23 million students are enrolled each year, only 7% successfully complete the full 
    pathway from elementary to college (<a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2079490/pbed-education-crisis-persists-jobs-
    gap-widen"> Sarao, 2025 </a>). This highlights the urgent need for stronger, more inclusive 
    education systems. </p>

 <h2>What's Being Done Now</h2>
 <p> The Department of Education (DepEd) has introduced the Quality Basic Education Development Plan 2025‚Äì2035, 
    a roadmap designed to reform the current education system. This includes revising the national curriculum, 
    building 40,000 new classrooms through public‚Äìprivate partnerships, and implementing the ARAL program to help 
    struggling learners catch up. Initiatives to improve digital learning, such as the DepEd Computerization 
    Program, are also being rolled out to provide laptops and smart TVs to public schools. </p> 
<p> Teacher training is also being prioritized, with the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP) 
    and PEAC offering professional development programs. These aim to enhance subject mastery, digital skills, 
    and inclusive teaching methods. Such efforts recognize that quality education depends not only on classrooms 
    and textbooks, but also on well-trained, motivated teachers. </p>

<h2>Where ARAL Comes In</h2>
<p>This is where ARAL steps in. As an advocacy group, we focus on bridging the gap for underserved learners by
     providing localized learning materials, organizing mentorship programs, and pushing for policy reforms that 
     prioritize equitable access. Our mission is simple: to ensure that every child, regardless of background, 
     has the opportunity to learn, grow, and achieve their dreams.</p>
